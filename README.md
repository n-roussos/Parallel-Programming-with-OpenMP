# Parallel Programming with OpenMP

This repository lists 4 problems solved using C. Each problem has its own serial and parallel implementations. For the latter, the OpenMP API was utilized.
The source code of this repository was developed for the "Parallel Programming for Machine Learning Problems" course conducted at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Patras, Greece.

##The repository outline is as follows:
**1. K-means:** A serial implementation of the [K-Means clustering algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)
**2. K-means with OpenMP:** The parallel implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm.
**3. Travelling salesman problem:** A serial and parallel solution to the [Travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).
**4. Neural networks:** A serial and parallel implementation of neural network using the [Fashion MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist) dataset.
**5. N queens problem:** A serial and parallel solution to the [N queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle). Apart from a simple implementation, a [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) approach is taken, as well.

*More details for each implementation can be found at each problem's corresponding folder.*
